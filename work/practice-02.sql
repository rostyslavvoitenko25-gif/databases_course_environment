-- Practice 2: write each query directly below its prompt, save this file, then run it.
-- From course-environment:
-- docker compose exec -T db psql -X -U student -d university -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -f /work/practice-02.sql
-- Each query reads practice.courses. Do not put answers in this starter file before class.

-- Q1: Return course_id and title for CS courses, ordered by course_id ascending.
SELECT course_id, title
FROM practice.courses
WHERE department = 'CS'
ORDER BY course_id;

-- Q2: Return course_id for courses with more than zero seats available, ordered by course_id ascending.
SELECT course_id
FROM practice.courses
WHERE seats_available > 0
ORDER BY course_id;

-- Q3: Return course_id and title for the first two available CS courses by credits descending, then course_id ascending.
SELECT course_id, title
FROM practice.courses
WHERE department = 'CS' AND seats_available > 0
ORDER BY credits DESC, course_id ASC

-- Q4: Return course_id for courses with at least five credits, ordered by course_id ascending.
